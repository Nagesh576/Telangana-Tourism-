                        Chowmahalla Palace, meaning "Four Palaces," is one of Hyderabad's most iconic and grand historical monuments. Built between the mid-18th and late-19th centuries, it served as the official residence of the Nizams, the rulers of Hyderabad. Spread across 12 acres today (originally 45 acres), the palace complex beautifully blends Persian, Indo-Saracenic, and European architectural styles. It consists of two main courtyards. The southern courtyard has four elegant palaces—Afzal Mahal, Tahniyat Mahal, Mahtab Mahal, and Aftab Mahal—featuring impressive arches and columns. The northern section houses the Bara Imam, a long corridor of administrative rooms, and the famous clock tower with the 250-year-old Khilwat Clock that still works. At the center is the Khilwat Mubarak Durbar Hall, adorned with stunning Belgian crystal chandeliers and intricate stucco work. Now a museum, Chowmahalla displays royal artifacts, manuscripts, costumes, and vintage cars. The palace received a UNESCO Asia-Pacific award for heritage conservation in 2010.
