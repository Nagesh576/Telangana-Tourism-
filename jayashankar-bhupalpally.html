The temple is believed to be over a thousand years old and features ancient architecture, including a mysterious Shiva lingam said to be connected to the river through hidden channels. The site draws thousands of devotees during Maha Shivaratri, Karthika Masam, and Pushkaralu festivals.

            <p>
                Nainpaka Temple, located near Jayashankar Bhupalpally town, is a unique 15th–16th century rock-cut shrine renowned for its rare Sarvatobhadra architecture, where the sanctum can be accessed from all four cardinal directions. Carved from pink granite, the temple's sanctum houses four deities—Yoga Narasimha Swamy (east), Kaleeya Venugopala Swamy (south), Sri Rama (north), and Balarama (west)—all sculpted from the same large boulder. The temple features a striking 50-foot vimana with a brick superstructure and stone base, showcasing medieval craftsmanship. Legend connects the temple to the demon Bakasura, said to have inspired its creation. Though now partially in ruins, the temple remains a testament to the artistic and spiritual heritage of Telangana. Its remote setting, distinctive design, and sacred significance attract history enthusiasts, pilgrims, and architecture lovers seeking to explore this hidden treasure of the region.
