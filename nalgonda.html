            <h2>Nagarjuna Sagar Dam</h2>
            <img src="images/Nagarjuna Sagar Dam.jpeg" alt="Nagarjuna Sagar Dam">
            <p>
                Nagarjuna Sagar Dam is one of the largest masonry dams in the world, built across the Krishna River between Telangana's Nalgonda district and Andhra Pradesh. Constructed between 1955 and 1967, the dam stands 124 meters high and stretches about 1.6 kilometers in length, with 26 massive floodgates. It plays a crucial role in irrigation, supplying water to over 9 lakh acres of farmland, and generates significant hydroelectric power, supporting the region's agriculture and energy needs. The dam creates a vast reservoir, Nagarjuna Sagar Lake, which is among India's largest man-made lakes. The site is a popular tourist attraction, especially during the monsoon when water gushes through the gates, offering a spectacular sight. Visitors can enjoy boat rides to Nagarjunakonda Island, famous for its Buddhist heritage. Nearby spots like Ethipothala Waterfalls and Buddhavanam further enhance its appeal. The dam symbolizes a blend of engineering brilliance, natural beauty, and cultural significance.

            <img src="images/Kolanupaka (Kolanpaku) Jain Temple.jpeg" alt="Kolanupaka Jain Temple">
            <p>
                Kolanupaka Jain Temple, also known as Kulpakji, is a revered ancient shrine located in Kolanupaka village, about 80 km from Hyderabad in Nalgonda district. Believed to be over 2,000 years old, the temple's present structure dates back nearly 800 years and is beautifully crafted from red sandstone with marble pillars. The temple houses three main idols: a 130 cm idol of Lord Mahavira carved from a single piece of jade, Lord Rishabhanatha (Adinath), and Lord Neminatha. According to legend, the idol of Rishabhanatha was once worshipped by Mandodari, the wife of Ravana. The temple also features intricate carvings of other Tirthankaras, Yakshas, and stained-glass artwork depicting Parshvanatha. Renovated with the help of artisans from Rajasthan and Gujarat, it remains an important pilgrimage center. The temple attracts thousands of devotees, especially during Chaitra Sud‑teras, and offers a peaceful spiritual atmosphere.

            <h2>Cheruvugattu Temple</h2>
            <img src="images/cherugattutemple.jpeg" alt="Cheruvugattu Temple">
            <p>
                Cheruvugattu Sri Parvathi Jadala Ramalingeshwara Swamy Temple is a famous hilltop shrine located near Narketpally in Nalgonda district, about 22 km from Nalgonda town. Dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, the temple is situated on a small rocky hill and can be reached by climbing around 365 steps or via a motorable path. The temple's unique feature is the Shiva Linga placed between three massive boulders, known as "Mudu Gundlu." Devotees pass through a narrow rock crevice, believing it washes away sins. It is believed that this Shiva Linga was installed by Lord Parashurama and is the last of 108 Lingas he consecrated. The temple gains special significance during the annual Cheruvugattu Jatara (Brahmotsavam) held in January or February, attracting thousands of devotees. The site offers a peaceful spiritual atmosphere with panoramic views of the surrounding region.
