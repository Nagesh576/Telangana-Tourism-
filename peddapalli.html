                Ramagiri Fort, also known as Ramagiri Khilla, is a majestic hilltop fortress located near Begumpet village in Peddapalli district, Telangana. Believed to have been constructed during the 12th century by the Kakatiya dynasty, the fort later came under the rule of the Qutb Shahi, Mughal, and Asaf Jahi dynasties. Perched on a hill at about 700 meters above sea level, the fort offers breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding forests and the confluence of the Godavari and Manair rivers. The fort complex features massive stone walls, octagonal bastions, gateways, watch towers, stables, ancient wells, and ruins of temples and mosques, reflecting a rich blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles. The area around the fort is known for its biodiversity, especially medicinal plants. A popular destination for trekkers, history enthusiasts, and photographers, Ramagiri Fort provides a perfect mix of heritage, nature, and adventure, making it a must-visit in Peddapalli.

            <img src="images/Dhulikatta Buddhist Stupa.jpeg" alt="Dhulikatta Buddhist Stupa">
            <p>
                Dhulikatta Buddhist Stupa, located in Dhulikatta village of Peddapalli district, is a significant ancient Buddhist site dating back to the 2nd century B.C. The stupa is part of a fortified monastic complex and reflects the architectural and spiritual brilliance of early Buddhism. It features a large central dome (Mahastupa), ayaka platforms aligned with cardinal directions, and a path for circumambulation. The stupa was once beautifully decorated with limestone panels depicting Buddhist symbols such as lotus flowers, swastikas, chatras (umbrellas), and Buddha's footprints. Excavations at the site revealed Roman and Satavahana coins, terracotta figurines, beads, seals, and other artifacts, indicating Dhulikatta's role as an important trade and cultural center. Mentioned in ancient records as one of 30 fortified towns, it remains a key destination for history enthusiasts and pilgrims exploring Telangana's Buddhist heritage. The site is best visited during the winter season for a comfortable experience.

            <img src="images/Sri Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple (Odela).jpeg" alt="Sri Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple Odela">
            <p>
                Sri Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple in Odela, Peddapalli district, is an ancient and sacred Shiva temple deeply rooted in local legends. The temple houses a self-manifested Shiva Linga, believed to have been first worshipped by sage Pankaja Maha Muni. Centuries later, a farmer named Odelu rediscovered it beneath an anthill, giving the village its name, Odela. The temple complex also features shrines dedicated to Bramarambha Mata, Sri Rama-Sita, Veerabhadra Swamy, and village deities Medala Devi and Kethamma. Devotees flock here to perform abhishekam, kumkumarchana, and nakabali rituals. The temple is especially vibrant during Maha Shivaratri, Tirukalyana Mahotsavam, and the Agni Gundaalu festival. Open daily from 5 AM to 8 PM, this temple draws thousands of pilgrims, offering a blend of spiritual significance, folk traditions, and historical charm.
