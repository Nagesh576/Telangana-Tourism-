                Dakshin Badrinath, also known as Badrivishal Dham, is a beautiful temple located at Banda Mailaram in Medchal–Malkajgiri district, about 40 km from Hyderabad. This temple is a replica of the famous Badrinath shrine in Uttarakhand and was constructed by the Uttarakhand Kalyankari Sanstha between 2017 and 2023. The temple stands 50 feet tall and covers around 6,750 square feet. The ground floor houses a spacious hall that can accommodate up to 350 people, while the sanctum on the first floor enshrines Lord Badrinath along with idols of Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Ganesh, Nar-Narayan, Kuber, Balarama, Narada, and Garuda. A special feature of this temple is the "Akhand Jyothi" (eternal flame) brought from the original Badrinath shrine. Unlike its Himalayan counterpart, Dakshin Badrinath is open to devotees throughout the year. The temple offers peaceful surroundings, traditional rituals, and basic facilities, making it a sacred destination for spiritual seekers.
