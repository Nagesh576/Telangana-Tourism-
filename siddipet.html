                        Kondapochamma Reservoir, also called Kondapochamma Sagar, is a modern engineering marvel located in Markook mandal of Siddipet district, about 50 km from Hyderabad. Completed in 2020 as part of the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Scheme, it plays a crucial role in supplying irrigation water and drinking water to Hyderabad and surrounding regions. The reservoir has a capacity of around 15 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) and is filled with water lifted from the Godavari River. The circular bund road, stretching about 15.8 km, offers breathtaking views of the vast water body, especially during sunrise and sunset. The reservoir has become a popular destination for nature lovers, photographers, and families looking for a peaceful retreat. Visitors often enjoy scenic drives and picnics along the reservoir. However, entry onto the bund itself is restricted for safety reasons. With minimal facilities available, it's best to carry food and water while visiting this serene and expansive spot.
