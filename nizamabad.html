            <h2>Nizamabad Fort (Qilla)</h2>
            <img src="images/Nizamabad Fort (Qilla).jpeg" alt="Nizamabad Fort">
            <p>
                Nizamabad Fort, also known as Nizamabad Qilla, is a historic hilltop fortress that stands as a symbol of the city's rich past. Built during the 10th century by the Rashtrakutas, the fort was later expanded and strengthened by the Kakatiyas, Bahmanis, Qutb Shahis, and the Nizams. The fort is strategically located on a hill, offering panoramic views of Nizamabad and its surroundings. Inside the fort complex, visitors can see ancient structures like the Raghunath (Jagannath) Temple, a mosque, barracks, a jail, and massive halls with natural air-cooling designs. The fort's thick stone walls, bastions, and impressive entrance arch reflect a blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles. Though some parts are in ruins, the fort continues to attract history enthusiasts and tourists. Its commanding location and majestic remnants make Nizamabad Fort a must-visit for those exploring Telangana's cultural and architectural heritage.

            <h2>Dichpally Ramalayam (Khilla Ramalayam)</h2>
            <img src="images/Dichpally Ramalayam.jpeg" alt="Dichpally Ramalayam">
            <p>
                Dichpally Ramalayam, also known as Khilla Ramalayam, is a 14th-century temple dedicated to Lord Rama, located about 20 km from Nizamabad. Built by the Kakatiya rulers, this beautiful temple is carved out of black and white basalt stone and is often referred to as the "Khajuraho of Telangana" due to its intricate carvings and sculptures. The temple walls, pillars, and doorways are adorned with detailed figures of gods, goddesses, animals, and floral designs. It stands atop a small hill, with 105 stone steps leading up to the sanctum, though a pedestrian tunnel also provides access. During monsoon, the surrounding area fills with water, giving the temple an island-like appearance. The temple complex once had a fort around it. It attracts many devotees, especially during Sri Rama Navami, and is admired for its unique architecture and spiritual significance.

            <h2>Pocharam Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
            <img src="images/Pocharam Wildlife Sanctuary.jpeg" alt="Pocharam Wildlife Sanctuary">
            <p>
                Pocharam Wildlife Sanctuary is a beautiful natural reserve spread over about 130 square kilometers across Nizamabad and Medak districts. Established in 1952, it was once the private hunting grounds of the Nizams of Hyderabad. The sanctuary surrounds the picturesque Pocharam Lake, formed by damming the Allair River in the early 20th century. The region consists of dry deciduous forests, grasslands, and marshes, offering rich biodiversity. Pocharam is famous for its wide variety of birds, including bar-headed geese, painted storks, herons, teals, and spoonbills, making it a paradise for birdwatchers. The sanctuary is also home to animals like nilgai, chital, sambar, wild boar, jackals, and sloth bears. Visitors can explore a 4.5 km nature trail, climb the old watchtower, and enjoy boating on the lake. The best time to visit is between October and May when wildlife sightings are most rewarding.
