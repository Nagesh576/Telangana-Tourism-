            <img src="images/Medaram (Sammakka-Saralamma Jathara Site).jpeg" alt="Medaram Sammakka-Saralamma Jathara Site">
            <p>
                Medaram, located in Mulugu district, is famous for the Sammakka-Saralamma Jathara, Asia's largest tribal festival and one of India's biggest human gatherings. Celebrated once every two years during Magha Pournami (January–February), the Jathara honors Sammakka and Saralamma, tribal warrior women who fought against injustice under the Kakatiya rule. The festival takes place deep inside the Eturnagaram forest, where devotees offer bangaram (jaggery) equal to their body weight, seeking blessings. A sacred stream, Jampanna Vagu, linked to their legend, is believed to purify sins. Tribal priests place bamboo sticks symbolizing the goddesses beneath a sacred tree as part of the ritual. The event draws millions, transforming the forest into a sea of devotion and vibrant cultural expression. The Telangana government ensures transport, health, and security facilities for pilgrims, making it a powerful symbol of Telangana's tribal heritage and spiritual unity.

            <h2>Bogatha Waterfalls</h2>
            <img src="images/Bogatha Waterfalls.jpeg" alt="Bogatha Waterfalls">
            <p>
                Bogatha Waterfalls, fondly known as the "Niagara of Telangana," is a stunning natural wonder located near Wazeedu in Mulugu district. It is the second-largest waterfall in the state, with waters cascading about 30 meters high and spreading nearly 200 meters wide during peak flow. The waterfall is set amidst thick forests, offering breathtaking views and a refreshing ambiance. Visitors must trek about 2–3 km from the nearest motorable point, making it ideal for adventure lovers. The best time to visit is during or just after the monsoon, from June to November, when the waterfall is at its most magnificent. A small temple dedicated to Sri Bhogadri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy nearby adds spiritual charm. The site also attracts birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts. Bogatha's serene setting and raw natural beauty make it a perfect getaway for those seeking peace and adventure.

            <p>
                Laknavaram Lake, located in Mulugu district, is a magnificent man-made lake built during the 13th century by the Kakatiya rulers. Spanning over 10,000 acres, it is surrounded by lush forests and small islands, offering a peaceful and picturesque setting. One of its major attractions is the 160-meter-long hanging bridge that connects three of the lake's thirteen islands, providing stunning views and a unique experience. The lake serves as a vital irrigation source for nearby farmlands and is a popular destination for boating, kayaking, camping, and nature walks. Managed by Telangana Tourism, the site features cottages, glass cabins, and luxury tents for visitors seeking a stay amidst nature. The best time to visit Laknavaram is during or after the monsoon when the water levels are high, and the greenery is at its peak, making it a perfect retreat for nature lovers and adventure seekers.
