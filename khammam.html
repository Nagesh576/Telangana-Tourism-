            <p>
                Khammam Fort, also known as Stambhadri Fort, is a magnificent hill fort that stands as a symbol of the region's rich history. Built in 950 AD by the Musunuri Nayaks, the fort was later strengthened and expanded by the Kakatiyas, Velamas, Qutb Shahis, and Nizams. Spread across 4 square kilometers on a granite hill, the fort features massive granite walls, bastions, and grand gateways like the Khilla Darwaza and Raathi Darwaza. Inside, one can find ancient temples, the Khilla Masjid (mosque), a palace built by Nawab Shoukat Jung, and the Zafar Baoli — an old stepwell used for rainwater harvesting. The fort's architecture is a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles, reflecting the diverse rulers who governed it. Now protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, Khammam Fort offers panoramic views of the city and hosts cultural events like the Stambhadri Sambaralu, drawing visitors and history enthusiasts alike.
