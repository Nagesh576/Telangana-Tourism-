            <p>
                Mitta Waterfalls, also known as Saptagundala Waterfalls, is a hidden natural treasure located near Pittalaguda village in Lingapur mandal of Komaram Bheem Asifabad district, Telangana. The site is named for its cluster of seven cascading streams that flow through dense forests and rocky terrain, creating a breathtaking spectacle, especially during and after the monsoon. The largest of these, Pedda Jalapatam, plunges dramatically over stone slabs into a deep valley, forming a stunning white cascade. Rich in local legend, the area is associated with Bheema from the Mahabharata, and visitors can spot rock impressions believed to be his footprints. Reaching the falls requires a moderately challenging trek of about 2 to 4 kilometers through scenic forest paths, making it a paradise for adventure lovers and nature enthusiasts. Best visited between October and February, the falls offer a serene escape, and a local guide is recommended for a safe and enriching experience.

                The Kumuram Bheem Memorial Museum, located at Jodeghat in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district, Telangana, is a tribute to the legendary Adivasi leader Kumuram Bheem.

Opened in 2016, the museum features traditional weapons, musical instruments, ornaments, tools, and artifacts showcasing the culture of Gond, Kollam, Thoti, and other tribal communities. Sculptures, murals, and photos depict the life, values, and sacrifices of Bheem and his people. The site also houses a large memorial statue of Bheem, surrounded by scenic forested hills. The museum is open daily from 10 AM to 5 PM, offering a deep cultural and historical experience, making it a must-visit site for history lovers and tourists alike.

            <h2>Sri Komaram Bheem Project (Reservoir)</h2>
            <img src="images/Sri Komaram Bheem Project (Reservoir).jpeg" alt="Sri Komaram Bheem Project Reservoir">
            <p>
                Sri Komaram Bheem Project, also known as Komaram Bheem Reservoir, is a medium irrigation project built across the Peddavagu River near Ada village in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district, Telangana. Completed in 2011, this earth-fill dam spans about 1,012 meters in length and rises 18 meters high, with a storage capacity of around 10.39 TMC. The reservoir aims to irrigate nearly 45,500 acres across several mandals, though full potential is yet to be realized due to incomplete canal networks. Surrounded by forested hills, the reservoir offers picturesque views and calm surroundings. In recent years, boating facilities have been introduced, attracting visitors seeking a peaceful nature retreat. The site holds great promise for eco-tourism, though development is still ongoing. Combining utility and scenic beauty, the Sri Komaram Bheem Project stands as both an engineering feat and an emerging tourist spot in northern Telangana.
