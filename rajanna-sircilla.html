                        Mid Manair Dam, officially known as <strong>Sri Rajarajeshwara Reservoir</strong>, is a major irrigation and water resource project located near Sircilla in Rajanna Sirisilla district, Telangana. Constructed across the Manair River and the SRSP flood flow canal, the dam plays a crucial role in supplying water to over two lakh acres of farmland. Completed as part of the ambitious Kaleshwaram and SRSP Stage II projects, the reservoir has a storage capacity of around 25 TMC ft. Beyond irrigation, the dam's scenic backwaters are emerging as a popular spot for tourism and recreation. The Telangana government has plans to introduce boating, water sports, cottages, and picnic areas to attract visitors. The reservoir is also being developed into a major hub for freshwater aquaculture, aimed at boosting the local economy. Mid Manair Dam thus combines utility, livelihood, and natural beauty, making it a vital asset for the region.
