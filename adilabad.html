            <img src="images/Kuntala Waterfalls.jpeg" alt="Kuntala Waterfalls">
            <p>
                Kuntala Waterfalls, located in Neradigonda mandal of Adilabad district, is the highest waterfall in Telangana, cascading from a height of about 45 meters (150 feet). Formed by the Kadam River, the waterfall is nestled within the dense forests and rolling hills of the Sahyadri range. The falls are especially magnificent during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons when the water gushes down in full force, creating a breathtaking sight and a cool mist that refreshes visitors. To reach the base of the waterfall, one needs to descend around 400 steps, which adds a sense of adventure to the visit. A natural pool forms at the bottom, attracting tourists who enjoy the scenic beauty and the soothing sound of the water. According to legend, the place is named after Shakuntala, who is said to have bathed here. Kuntala is a perfect getaway for nature lovers, photographers, and adventure enthusiasts.

            <p>
                Pochera Waterfalls is a stunning natural wonder located in Boath mandal of Adilabad district, Telangana. This multi-tiered waterfall drops from a height of about 20 meters (65 feet) and is formed by tributaries of the Godavari River. Surrounded by thick teak forests and rocky landscapes of the Sahyadri hills, the waterfall offers a breathtaking sight, especially during and after the monsoon season when the water flow is at its peak. The water cascades over wide granite rocks into a deep, emerald pool at the base, creating a serene yet powerful atmosphere. The area is accessible by road, followed by a short walk to the viewing points. Visitors are advised to be cautious near the pool, as the rocks can be slippery. Pochera is ideal for nature lovers, photographers, and those seeking a peaceful retreat amidst lush greenery.

                Jainath Temple, also known as Sri Lakshmi Narayana Swamy Temple, is a historic and sacred shrine located about 22 km from Adilabad in Jainath village.
